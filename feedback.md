# Project Evaluation (9/15)
Reference: https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md

Good work! Your code is clean and organized! Great effort handling multiple models.

## Technical Requirements (2)

Full CRUD functionality is present on one or two models.

## Creativity and Interface (1)

The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page

## Code Quality (2)

Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Functionality (2)

Application contains no major errors

## Planning / Process / Submission (2)

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.

## Other Feedback:
- It might be a good idea to group your views by category. You can have a folder for pants, one for shoes, and so on. Each folder can have the related views.
- One thing else to consider is to consolidate your models into one model. Currently, all your models have the same properties. If you consolidate your models into one model, you can remove more than half the code in this project.
